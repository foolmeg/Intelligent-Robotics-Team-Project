Project Proposal: Autonomous Navigation in Unknown Dynamic Human Environments using Path Planning and Obstacle Avoidance
Members: Meghna Jagadeesh, Shuanglin Hu, Youngbin Park, Yuhang Li
Problem and Goal
A core challenge in modern robotics is enabling autonomous operation in unstructured, human-populated environments like offices or hospitals. In these settings, a robot cannot rely on a pre-existing map and must tackle the unpredictable motion of people. While traditional path planners such as the A* algorithm assume a static, known world, this project seeks to address the more complex and realistic problem of navigating from a start point to a goal in a completely unknown environment that contains dynamic human obstacles. This forces the robot to simultaneously build its understanding of the world and make intelligent, safe navigation decisions in real-time.
Technical Approach
Our approach implements a hierarchical navigation system in Webots, integrating three core components: real-time Occupancy Grid Mapping for environment perception, D* Lite for global path planning, and the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) for local obstacle avoidance. The simulated robot begins with no prior map, incrementally building an occupancy grid from lidar data. D* Lite uses this evolving map to plot and replan efficient paths as new obstacles like humans are discovered, while DWA provides immediate reactive control to avoid immediate collisions. While these algorithms are established in literature, our contribution lies in the integrated implementation and a thorough analysis of their interactions, failure modes, and trade-offs in a dynamic, unknown setting.
Hypotheses and Evaluation 
We hypothesise that this integrated approach will enable robust navigation but will reveal specific limitations. We expect D* Lite to efficiently handle map discoveries but struggle if human motion exceeds its replanning frequency. Similarly, we anticipate that DWA will prevent most collisions but may induce fluctuating or hesitant behaviour near unpredictable humans. We also presume that failures will primarily stem from the system's limited ability to predict human trajectories and delays in map updates. To evaluate these hypotheses, we will design experiments in Webots with varying human densities (sparse vs. dense) and human movement patterns (random vs. goal-directed). We aim to assess the system using metrics such as success rate, path efficiency, number of collisions, and replanning latency. A crucial part of our evaluation will be a qualitative analysis of failure cases, such as the robot becoming trapped or oscillating, to provide deep insights into the algorithmic trade-offs between global planning and local reaction.
